Refactorings:
- Compose method
-- Method for calculate offer value, expiration date, assign offer, and save offer
-- Let's go to each method
- Extract class
-- Extract class from method (CalculateOfferValue -> OfferValueCalculator)
- Rename method (CalculateOfferValue -> Calculate)
- Extract interface
- Field, use base type where possible
- Introduce parameter
-- Also add the DI configuration (Maybe)

SHORT VERSION
- Make member non-static (Calculate Expiration Date)

LONG VERSION
- Move member (Calculate expiration date -> OfferType)
- Make member non-static
-- Undo, then make member non-static directly


- Encapsulate collection
-- For member -> offer
-- Want to have bi-directional relationship
-- Bunch of actions I don't support
-- Member.AddOffer
--- Extract method, make method non-static

- Encapsulated operations
-- Member.AssignOffer()
- Double dispatch
-- calculating discount percentage

- Introduce constructor
-- Adding Member to offer ctor
-- inlining value
- Private setters
-- Removing Offer.MemberAssigned()

MAYBE

- Primitive obsession
-- Offer Expiration Type - sliding/absolute
-- Create enumeration classes (SmartEnum<ExpirationType>)
-- Make switch just use constants
-- Move method to enum class
-- Extract method and make method non-static for OfferType
-- Calculate based on double dispatch w/ offer type

LONG VERSION
-- EF Core, use OnModelCreating, modelBuilder.Entity.Property(...).HasConversion()
